+I want you to make fractal 3d visualization that I can view in the browser.

# 2024-08-08 20:33:01.853803
+Amazing! Good start! Can we add some cool glow?

# 2024-08-08 20:33:39.660877
+Now it's just a black screen

# 2024-08-08 20:34:32.980478
+It's still just a black screen!

+Update my 3D visualization so that the colors of the dots are a gradient proportional to the distance from the function edge.

+Change the color of each dot to a gradient proportional to the center of the bulb. Change the color cyclicaly. 

# 2024-08-08 20:43:22.240001
+Change so that the dots are speheres and not squares.

+How can we improve the performance of the code to allow for a high number of spheres? I'm using a Macbook Pro M1. Can we somehow use hardware acceleration?

# 2024-08-08 20:57:06.214844
+Now, have the spheres move between this configuration and anoteher configuration. The other configuration should be a hollow sphere with a radius that apporaximately contains the blobs surface.

# 2024-08-08 20:59:17.254336
+Now update it so that the interpolation also happens in reverse back to the initial shape, and then loops

# 2024-08-08 21:01:31.077359
+Now let's add sound effects! Play a synthesizer arpeggio and switch between two chords during the interpolation.

# 2024-08-08 21:02:27.759009
+How do I hear the sound? When I reload I still don't hear any music.

# 2024-08-08 21:03:31.412608
+Ok! Great! But make the music sound more space-age and cool, like David Bowie in Berlin.

# 2024-08-08 21:04:49.881576
+Coool! But add more pads and make it more drony.
